# BDD-Clock-JBehave

JBehave - Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) framework and evolution of test-driven development (TDD) in Agile Methodologies which is a
acceptance-test driven design, and is intended to make these practices more accessible and intuitive to newcomers and experts alike.

Here, I have taken Berlin Clock example (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mengenlehreuhr) and written sample test cases in berlin-clock.story file 
then developed business logic based on the test cases.

Once you run the Gradle successfully, the JBehave frameworks generates the test reports inside the jbehave folder.
